## Bird's-Eye Review

Full audit of the vault landscape. Shows every effort with zero suppression — useful for weekly reviews, after a break, or when you need to see everything. For daily agenda, use `/pulse` and let it emerge from conversation.

### If no daily note exists for today:

#### Sense

1. **Scan all Maps** in `Maps/` — read each file to find open loops, active threads, and items with deadlines.

2. **Scan active Notes** — find notes in `Notes/` where `status: active` or `status: waiting`, especially those with `due` dates approaching.

#### Route — ordering only, no suppression

3. **Group by context batch** to minimize context switching.

4. **Sort batches** by combined `priority_weight` of their efforts (highest batch first).

5. **Within each batch**, sort items by individual effort priority weight.

#### Surface

6. **Generate the Daily note** using the template structure:

```markdown
---
type: daily
date: YYYY-MM-DD
generated: true
efforts_touched: []
items_completed: 0
items_deferred: 0
---
# YYYY-MM-DD

## Context A: [batch name] [combined weight: X.XX]
- [ ] Item from highest-priority effort [[linked note or Map]]
- [ ] Next item [[link]]

## Context B: [batch name] [combined weight: X.XX]
- [ ] Item [[link]]

## Context C: [batch name] [combined weight: X.XX]
- [ ] Item [[link]]

## Context D: [batch name] [combined weight: X.XX]
- [ ] Item [[link]]

---
## Annotations

## End of Day
```

#### Act

7. **Write the file** to `Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

### If a daily note already exists:

This path is pure Surface — show progress and invite adjustment.

1. Read the existing daily note.
2. Show current progress — how many items checked vs total.
3. Surface any new items that emerged since generation.
4. Ask if the user wants to add, remove, or reprioritize items.

### Principles
- Every batch is rendered fully — no suppression, no collapsed lines
- Each checklist item should link to a Note or Map section
- Keep items actionable and concrete, not vague
- If an effort has no open loops, omit it from the checklist
- $ARGUMENTS can optionally specify a date other than today

### Relationship to /pulse
/pulse builds a focused daily agenda conversationally (8-15 items). /birdseyereview shows EVERYTHING — useful when you need the full instrument panel, not the cockpit.
