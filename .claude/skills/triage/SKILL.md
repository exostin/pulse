## Auto-Triage

Process untriaged items from `Inbox/` into the PULSE system. Execute immediately, report what was done.

### Act — Multi-Agent Intake

**Phase -1 — Process multi-agent task results** from `Inbox/multi-agents/` (runs first, before agent writes):

1. Glob `Inbox/multi-agents/*.md` — exclude `CLAUDE.md` and `archive/`. If none, skip this phase.
2. For each file, read frontmatter (`status`, `effort`, `task`, `agent_name`) and the `## Result` section.
3. Present a one-line summary per result: `Agent result: [task] ([effort]) — [status]`
4. If `## Vault Updates Needed` is non-empty, apply the suggested changes directly to vault files.
5. Move processed files to `Inbox/multi-agents/archive/[filename]`.
6. Log: `### Multi-Agent Intake — HH:MM` with per-result traces to Session Log.

### Sense — Scan and Classify

1. **Find untriaged items** — scan `Inbox/` (not `Inbox/multi-agents/`) for files where `triaged: false` in frontmatter.

2. **If no untriaged items**, report "Inbox clear" and stop.

3. **For each untriaged item**, analyze the content:

   a. **Match against Maps** — read the content and compare against Map purposes and active threads to determine the best `efforts[]` assignment, `status`, and `context_group`.

   a2. **Detect dependencies** — scan the capture body for:
      - Wiki-links (`[[note-slug]]`) referencing existing Notes
      - Dependency language ("blocked on", "after", "need X before", "depends on", "prerequisite", "waiting on")
      - If a dependency is detected, record the target note slug(s) for use in frontmatter and Map entry

### Act — File and Update

   b. **Create or append**:
      - If the content is a new thread: create a Note in `Notes/` with proper frontmatter (type, subtype, efforts, status, dates, effort_level, timescale, importance, depends, related, context_group, tags). Assess content to assign `importance: low|medium|high` based on the item's significance and immediacy. Populate `depends: [note-slug]` if dependencies were detected in step 3a2. Filename: `Notes/[descriptive-slug].md`
      - If the content clearly extends an existing Note: read the target note, append content, update `updated` date.

   c. **Update relevant Maps** (compressed pointer):
      - For each effort in the note's `efforts[]`, read the corresponding Map
      - Add a compressed pointer under the appropriate section:
        `- [[note-slug]] — [≤15-word summary] (subtype, date)`
      - If dependencies were detected: include in the pointer:
        `- [[note-slug]] — [≤15-word summary] (subtype, date, depends:: [[dep-slug]])`
      - Do NOT inline note content or extended summaries into the Map
      - Increment `open_loops` count in the Map's frontmatter
      - Update `last_active` to today

   d. **Mark capture as triaged**:
      - Update the Inbox file's frontmatter: set `triaged: true` and fill in `efforts[]`

   e. **Archive the triaged capture**: move the file to `Inbox/archive/[filename]`

### Surface — Report

4. **Report summary** (in chat):

```
Auto-triaged N items:
- [title] → [effort(s)] (new note / appended to "[existing note]")
- [title] → [effort(s)] (new note / appended to "[existing note]")
...
```

### Act — Log

5. **Log triage decisions** — append a timestamped classification trace to `Daily/logs/YYYY-MM-DD-log.md`. Create the file (and `Daily/logs/` directory) if they don't exist. Do NOT write this to the Daily note itself.

   Format:
   ```
   ### Triage — HH:MM

   - [inbox-file-slug] → [effort(s)] as [subtype] "[note-slug]" (new|appended)
     Match rationale: [one line — which Map purpose/thread matched and why]
     Dependencies detected: [[dep-1]], [[dep-2]] | none
   - [inbox-file-slug] → [effort(s)] as [subtype] "[note-slug]" (new|appended)
     Match rationale: [one line]
     Dependencies detected: none
   ```

   The match rationale is the key artifact — it records *why* this capture was assigned to this effort, so a later `/defrag` misclassification check (or manual audit) can evaluate the reasoning. Keep it to one line per item.

   If no Daily Note exists yet, create one with minimal frontmatter (no Session Log section — that goes in `Daily/logs/`).

### Principles
- **No confirmation cycles.** Execute immediately. The cost of a misclassified note is low — `/defrag` catches mistakes later.
- Cross-effort notes are encouraged — don't force single-effort assignment
- If a capture could go multiple ways, pick the best match. Defrag will flag misclassifications.
- $ARGUMENTS can optionally specify a specific Inbox file to triage
